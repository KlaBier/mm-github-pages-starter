I started my experiences with the Microsoft Server Technologies in 1998 and it was exciting for me to be a part of the growing process of the entire Microsoft Identity Technologies in the last years. To see how products and technologies becomes more and more stable, with a more on functionality. From the beginning, with the early Windows Server Active Directory running on W2K boxes till today, where customers are in the cloud, facing with hybrid scenarios and where user are authenticating and getting access from around the globe. A challenging world from an identity perspective

I have a full time job as an Solution Architect and I am supporting customers with questions and topics around the Active Directory Family and topics in Azure AD or related technolgies in the Microsoft Cloud.  **<u>This is my personal blog and nothing will be shared and provided, neither from my customers nor from my employer.</u>** 

I am also a occasional author and publish from time to time articles in the paper press or in the internet.

The motivation for this blog is that I am getting lot's of informations from the internet and from the identity community. And my motivation is <u><b>not</b></u> making money in any kind with this block.
I follow a couple of realy impressing  guys which makes my job sometimes easier with informations and experiences that they provide in different medias. Because of this I started that blog - to give something back, from my experience in daily projects and from my development and my learning process - without financial interest

I live in the wonderful Murnau, which is in the Garmisch-Partenkirchen area, close to the Austria border. I love sports, especialy running in the mountains. Nature is for me to consider something from my job or from my live.
